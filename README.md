## About

I'm a Full Stack Developer and a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) with 5 years of management experience.

I love building memorable, clean, and highly usable projects.

I have experience managing dozens of employees, hundreds of volunteers, and over \$2 million in small business revenue and non-profit program budgets.

I'm an enthusiastic hiker, an avid reader, and a fortunate husband and father.
